			<h1>Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic</h1>
			<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has effected the human race as a whole. In this blog the pros/cons of the response to the pandemic will be discussed. While the majority will view the pandemic as a negative event (and rightfully so) there are positives that can be seen as a result of this devastating event in human history. <p>

			<h2>Social Implications</h2>
			<p>The pandemic plagued not only our health but our sociability. As a response to the pandemic, we were told to stay indoors much of the time and to keep our faces covered. This limited how we were able to interact and for most in a negative manner. A positive was the reaction of tech companies, they created new or more improved video conferencing technology to aid in that interactionn (ex. Zoom). </p>

			<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
			<p>The economy suffered tremendously under new guidelines via the W.H.O., borders closing to prevent the spread--effectiveley prevented the spread but also prevented the spread of suppliers and much needed manufactured goods (ex. micro-chips)To tie into the political portion of the blog the distribution of the dollar to the masses as a form of financial relief, effected inflation within the United States. Which in turn decreased the value oof the dollar due to the printing of more money to distribute. </p>

			<h2>Political Implications</h2>
			<p>Politically speaking in my opnion it aided tremendously in the efforts of elections. It gave politicians another tool to use, to say "this can be remedied if you elect me!". It also detracted from politics in that, people were dieing and suffering and those people put in charge (house,senate, president) in the government were blamed relentlessly resulting in a mistrust of government officials.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Altogether the pandemic was a very polarizing time for us as people. Many negatives can be found including the deaths of countless lives and business closings due to lack of trade and spread prevention. Through this pandemic we have persevered and progressed technology, realizing this can happen again and that we can adapt. </p>
