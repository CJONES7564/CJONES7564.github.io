			<h2>Social Implications</h2>
			<p>The pandemic plagued not only our health but our sociability. As a response to the pandemic, we were told to stay indoors much of the time and to keep our faces covered. This limited how we were able to interact and for most in a negative manner. A positive was the reaction of tech companies, they created new or more improved video conferencing technology to aid in that interactionn (ex. Zoom). </p>
