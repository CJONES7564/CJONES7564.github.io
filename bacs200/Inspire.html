	This is Major Dick Winters he is a hero to me due to the many instances during WW2 he displayed courage,decicevness, and honor. You might be familiar with him if youve seen the HBO mini-series "Band of Brothers" this is for the most part about him and his command with easy company throughout WW2. Some of his highlighting achievments include: Successfully leading the Normandy Landings, D-Day Operations, Various other critical operations throughout the war.
